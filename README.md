# borderline-insanity

A game i worked on with two of my friends in 2019.
In the game you play as Tom. A teen adult living alone in his apartment, dreaming on becoming a better man.
- You can earn money by doing jobs (mini games).
- Speak to friends.
- Enter Tom's dreams
In Tom's dreams he fights his anti self, open chests, get item, and change the enviorment, because it is ofcourse a dream.

special credits to my friends:
- Me (head programmer)
- Anregni (artist + programmer)
- Daikokuten (main artist)
